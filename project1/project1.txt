A NUM is generated by the following process.

In the main function the line, line number, and character position are passed to the next function

From this point, any whitespace will be removed and the character at that position will be identified
as either a LETTER, DIGIT, SPEICAL character, or INVALID

If the character is a DIGIT the information will be passed to the
recognizedNUM function which will declare a string of all the consequtive numerical values

Once the complete string is retrieved the token is returned along with the end position of the token
the token is then returned to the main function to be printed.

Code Snippet

from main() ln 129

ln 137
char_pos, token = next(ln, ln_num, char_pos)

from next() ln 111

ln 121
elif char in DIGITS: return recognizeNUM(ln, ln_num, char_pos)

from recognizedNUM ln 82

ln 82-92 
def recognizeNUM(ln, ln_num, char_pos):  
    value=""
    kind="NUM"
    position=char_pos
    
    while position < len(ln):
        if ln[position] not in DIGITS: break
        value=value+ln[position]
        position+=1
        
    return position, Lexeme(ln_num, char_pos, kind, value)
