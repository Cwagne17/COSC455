;; This buffer is for text that is not saved, and for Lisp evaluation.
;; To create a file, visit it with C-x C-f and enter text in its buffer.

(quote a)
(quote(1 2 3))
(atom 'a) ;; t stands for true, () is false
(atom (quote a)) ;; same as above
(atom (atom 'a)) ;; inside is input for outer atom
;; evaluates list inside of the cursor

'(a b c) ;; defines that the rest of the list is a quote

(atom '(1 2 3 )) ;; returns nil if evaluating outer list b/c list is not an atom

(eq 'a 'b) ;; comparing atoms

() ;; empty list is both an atom and a list
