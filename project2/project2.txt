To run the project2.py program.

1. Make the project2.py file executeable

chmod +x project2.py

2. Then run the program with an input file

./project2.py "examples/if.txt"

Takes input from command line.

The output of the program should:
    return true when syntactically correct

    when a syntax error is encountered the parser stops (terminate execution) and returns the position and the error

    when the file is empty it will print "File is empty."
